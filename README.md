## Project Overview

In this project, I have developed a user-friendly URL shortening application that simplifies the process of converting long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. The core functionality involves taking user-provided lengthy web addresses and generating concise equivalents. These shortened URLs are securely stored in DynamoDB, ensuring data persistence and easy retrieval for users who wish to access the original URL.

## Technologies Used

**AWS API Gateway:** Used to create the API endpoints that handle URL shortening and redirection requests.

**AWS Lambda:** Hosts the application logic for URL shortening and redirection.
Amazon DynamoDB: Stores the mapping between short URLs and their corresponding long URLs securely.
Node.js: Used for serverless functions in AWS Lambda.

**Serverless Framework:** Facilitates deployment and management of AWS Lambda functions.
